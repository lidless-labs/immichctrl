# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Bumped `@lidless-labs/effect-operator-kit` to `1505318b2625fc273c51018389e2c61677e073d7`. Tool results, including error results, are now capped at 90,000 UTF-8 bytes. An oversize result is cut with a `[truncated: output was N bytes, limit is M bytes ...]` marker and carries `structuredContent: { truncated: true, ... }`. Results under the cap keep the existing content-only, 2-space JSON shape.
- Tool annotations are now built with the kit's `annotationsForTier`. Reads and destructive tools keep their meaning; each hint is now explicit (`destructiveHint: false` on reads, plus `idempotentHint` and `openWorldHint` on every tool). Safe writes keep `destructiveHint: false`. An unknown tier now resolves to destructive.

### Added
- Authenticated Streamable HTTP mode on `/mcp` with per-session MCP servers, bounded sessions and request bodies, idle expiry, and graceful shutdown. Start with `node dist/index.js --http` or `immichctrl mcp --http`. The default port is `3112`.
- Claude Code and Codex HTTP configuration examples and a hardened example systemd user service.
- `IMMICH_CA_CERT` option: path to a PEM CA bundle trusted for Immich requests (added to Node's default trust store: bundled Mozilla roots plus `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` on Node 22.15+/23.9+, bundled roots only on older Node), so self-signed setups can keep verification on.

### Fixed
- Error results, CLI errors and fatal startup messages now redact the Immich API key and any credentials embedded in `IMMICH_BASE_URL` (previously Node's "URL includes credentials" error echoed the password). Redaction runs on the whole message before the 90,000 byte cap, so the cap cannot cut a secret in half and leave a fragment.
- `immich_remove_assets_from_album` and `immich_remove_tag_from_assets` now declare `destructiveHint: true`. They still need only `IMMICH_ALLOW_WRITES` (no `confirm` flag); the hint lets clients that prompt on destructive tools prompt for them.
- `IMMICH_BASE_URL` set to a bare server origin (for example `https://photos.example.com`) no longer produces 404s. The URL is normalized to end with `/api`, so both the origin and the `/api` form work. Contributed by @rokelvisar in #9.
- `IMMICH_VERIFY_SSL=false` no longer sets `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0`, which disabled certificate checks for every connection in the process. The opt-out now installs a dedicated HTTPS agent for Immich requests only and logs a one-time warning.
- The scoped Immich fetch now times out after 300 seconds and honors the caller's `AbortSignal`, so a stalled server can no longer hang a request forever.

### Security
- Certificate verification is on by default, and no code path changes TLS verification process-wide.
- HTTP requires an independent bearer token and rejects invalid Host and Origin headers before authentication. Host filesystem uploads and CSV exports are disabled over HTTP, even when Immich writes are enabled. Stdio keeps its existing behavior.

### Tests
- Added an HTTPS integration test (throwaway CA and leaf, real SDK call) covering the CA bundle and verification opt-out paths, plus timeout and abort tests.

### Docs
- Rewrote `README.md` to the OSS adoption standard: a what / why / how-it-differs opening, a prominent website link, an `npx -y immich-mcp` MCP client config block, a verified quickstart, a corrected tool list (74 tools across 16 domains, replacing the stale "~55 tools across 11 domains" count and adding the previously undocumented album-flow, memory-flow, duplicate-flow, trash, and jobs domains), and "Why not the other options?" and "What immich-mcp is not" sections.
- Added maintainer health files: `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, GitHub issue templates (`bug.yml`, `feature.yml`, `config.yml`), and a pull request template.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added
- New `safetyMode` input on `immich_find_byte_dupes` + `immich_resolve_with_keep_strategy` with three levels:
  - `strict-checksum` (default): Immich CLIP group + SHA1 match. Zero false positives.
  - `clip-name-size-time`: CLIP group + filename + size + fileCreatedAt all match. Catches re-encodes/re-imports.
  - `clip-only`: CLIP group only. Most permissive, requires manual review.
- New tool `immich_find_clip_dupes` - finds visual-not-byte-identical CLIP-grouped pairs and reports a per-bucket divergence summary (checksums/filenames/sizes/takenAt).
- New tool `immich_compare_assets` - side-by-side metadata diff of 2-10 assets with divergence + recommendation string.
- New tool `immich_audit_active` - housekeeping candidates in the active library, with `excludeAlbumAssets` + `excludeFavorites` defaulting to true so curated content is skipped.

### Changed (behavior change)
- `matchMode` input deprecated in favor of `safetyMode`. `matchMode: "checksum"` still works as an alias for `safetyMode: "strict-checksum"`.
- `matchMode: "name-size"` now returns a deprecation error directing users to `safetyMode: "clip-name-size-time"` (which is safer because it also requires `fileCreatedAt` to match, not just `filename`+`size`).
- `matchReason` enum gains `clip-name-size-time` and `clip-only` to label safety-mode buckets honestly.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-05-18

### Changed (behavior change)
- **Default dedup match changed from `(filename, fileSizeInByte)` to SHA1 checksum.** v0.3-v0.4.1 labeled their matching as "byte-exact" but used filename+size only. Real example found 2026-05-18: three videos with identical filename, size, and timestamp but three distinct SHA1 checksums. The v0.4.2 default `matchMode: "checksum"` provides true byte-identity. Weaker `matchMode: "name-size"` is still selectable as an opt-in heuristic.
- `matchReason` enum: `byte-exact` removed. Replaced by `checksum-exact` (when assets share SHA1) and `name-size-match` (when same filename+size only).

### Added
- `matchMode` input on `immich_find_byte_dupes` and `immich_resolve_with_keep_strategy`. Default `"checksum"`.
- New tool `immich_audit_trash` - cross-checks every trashed asset against active library by checksum (or name+size); reports orphans (potentially-unique content) so you can spot risk before permanent deletion. Supports `exportTo` for full CSV manifest.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed
- `buildAssetAlbumIndex` now fails fast on errors instead of silently returning an empty map. With `albumAware: true` (the default), a 403/500/SDK shape change in the albums endpoint used to silently downgrade the keeper decision to strategy-only, which could trash curated assets. Errors now propagate to the tool handler and surface as a clear MCP error.
- `exportTo` in `immich_resolve_with_keep_strategy` is now gated by `IMMICH_ALLOW_WRITES` (it is a filesystem write). Previously a caller with writes disabled could still cause the CSV to be written. The CSV writer also now (1) verifies the parent directory exists and surfaces a clear error otherwise, and (2) uses the `wx` flag so it refuses to overwrite an existing file.
- CSV cells whose values begin with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, `\t`, or `\r` are now prefixed with a single quote to neutralize spreadsheet formula injection (CWE-1236) before the cell is RFC-4180 quoted.
- `immich_explain_duplicate_group` recommendation is now deterministic across runs (final tiebreaker on asset id) and the `rationale` only mentions signals that actually contributed to the winner over the runner-up. The previous version always appended "oldest" even when the pick was driven by album membership or favorite status.
- `webBaseUrl` inputs are now schema-validated to `http://` or `https://` only (previously `z.string().url()` accepted `javascript:`, `ftp:`, etc.), and asset ids are URL-encoded into the path to handle ids with spaces or reserved characters.
- `tailSample` now actually samples the long tail: the 10 buckets with the lowest reclaimable bytes (tiebroken on `duplicateId`), instead of the lex-first 10 by `duplicateId`.

### Changed (behavior change)
- `EnrichedBucket` shape for flagged buckets: `keeper` is now `null` and `discards` is `[]` instead of an arbitrary placeholder. A new optional `members: EnrichedAssetRef[]` array contains every asset in the flagged bucket so callers can still display the data. Flagged buckets also report `reclaimableBytes: 0` (nothing was selected). The CSV writer emits empty cells for `keeperId`/`keeperFileCreatedAt`/`keeperAlbums`/`discardIds`/`discardAlbums` on flagged rows.
- `immich_categorize_duplicates` output keys are now hyphenated (`byte-exact`, `resolution-variants`, `burst-sequence`) instead of snake_case (`byte_exact`, `resolution_variants`, `burst_sequence`). This unifies the category vocabulary with the bucket-level `matchReason` field that was already hyphenated. v0.2.0 shipped snake_case and v0.4.0 introduced the inconsistency by hyphenating `matchReason`; v0.4.1 fixes it before it becomes entrenched. Backward-incompatible for callers that consume `byCategory.*` by name.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added
- `immich_explain_duplicate_group` tool for per-group drill-in (assets + album memberships + recommended keeper).
- Album-aware keeper selection in `immich_find_byte_dupes` and `immich_resolve_with_keep_strategy` (input: `albumAware`, default `true`). Buckets with split curation are flagged for manual review instead of swept.
- Enriched per-bucket detail in dry-run output: `topByReclaim`, `tailSample`, `flagged` arrays with keeper + discards + album memberships + optional web URLs.
- `matchReason` field on every dedup bucket.
- `restoreNote` field on every resolve response (clarifies undo path).
- CSV export for resolve plans via `exportTo` input.

### Changed
- `immich_find_byte_dupes` output shape extends to include `topByReclaim`, `tailSample`, `flagged`. Existing `candidates` array preserved for back-compat.
- `immich_resolve_with_keep_strategy` dry-run output shape extends similarly. Existing `plan` aggregate preserved.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed
- `immich_list_trash` now actually returns trashed items. The previous implementation passed `isTrashed: true` to `searchAssets`, which the Immich server silently ignored, so the tool returned non-trash assets from the main timeline. The tool now uses `withDeleted: true` plus an epoch sentinel for `trashedAfter` and post-filters the returned items to `isTrashed === true`.
- `immich_restore_by_query` had the same search-side bug and additionally called `updateAssets({ isTrashed: false })`, which the SDK also silently dropped: nothing was ever restored. The tool now calls the dedicated `restoreAssets({ bulkIdsDto: { ids } })` endpoint, pages through trash until exhausted or `maxRestore` is hit, and requires `confirm: true` when invoked with no filter (would otherwise restore every trashed asset).
- `immich_run_job` now requires `confirm: true` for destructive queue commands (`empty`, `clear-failed`). Other commands (`start`, `pause`, `resume`) are unchanged.
- `immich_suggest_face_names` no longer returns `thumbnailPath` (a server-side file path that is not useful to callers and was not in the spec). Response shape is now `{ personId, faceCount }`; pair with `immich_get_person_assets` to fetch a sample asset per person.
- `immich_search_then_album` now rejects when both `smartQuery` and `metadataFilter` are provided. The previous implementation silently dropped `metadataFilter`.
- `immich_daily_digest` now filters new uploads by `createdAfter` (upload time) instead of `takenAfter` (capture time). New imports of old photos now count correctly.
- `test:integration` script now builds the project before invoking the integration suite (`npm run build && IMMICH_INTEGRATION=true vitest ...`).
- `withRetry` now logs one stderr line per retry attempt for minimal production observability. The `label` parameter is no longer discarded.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added
- Composed LLM-native tools: `immich_memories_today`, `immich_daily_digest`, `immich_suggest_face_names`, `immich_search_then_album`.
- Trash domain: `immich_list_trash`, `immich_empty_trash` (writes + confirm), `immich_restore_by_query`.
- Jobs domain: `immich_list_jobs`, `immich_run_job`.
- Retry/backoff helper (`src/retry.ts`) on HTTP 429 and 5xx responses.
- Sharper error parsing in `surfaceError` (differentiates 401/403/404/429/5xx).
- GitHub Actions CI: typecheck + test + build on Node 20 and 22.
- Renovate config for weekly dependency bumps.
- Live integration test suite under `tests/integration/`, gated by `IMMICH_INTEGRATION=true`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added
- Composed dedup tools: `immich_categorize_duplicates`, `immich_find_byte_dupes`, `immich_resolve_with_keep_strategy`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- Initial release. 56 MCP tools across 11 domains (system, assets, search, albums, people, tags, shared links, activities, memories, duplicates, stacks). Wraps `@immich/sdk`. Two-tier write protection: `IMMICH_ALLOW_WRITES` env + per-call `confirm: true`. README with five-MCP-client setup.
